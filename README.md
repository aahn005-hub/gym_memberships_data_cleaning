# Data Cleaning of gym_membership

## Introduction
A simple data cleaning of the dataset, gym_membership, taken from Kaggle. I originally thought of doing this
so I can showcase my data cleaning skills. These skills include: Locating NULLS or empty spaces, altering and 
updating tables to add or remove columns, and converting multiple datatypes.
